        "Yurii Shevchenko worked on the music for the ballet for almost a year. He used motifs from Vadym Homoliaka's music for the film 'Chasing Two Hares'. The leitmotif of the ballet, which features quadrille, tango, and folk melodies, became the lively couplets of Holokhvastov.",
        "Yurii Shevchenko described the music for the ballet as follows: 'At first glance, my music seems simple. But there was a period when I didn't know how to recreate the right intonation... The music had to be light and ironic. Not silly and cheerful, but ironic. But how to achieve that? Or, for example, how to make the folk dances at the market? It could have been something like the Virsky Ensemble. But I needed it to be folk, but not quite... I saw irony in the fact that you're kind of laughing, the music seems cheerful, but it ends a little sadly. Or it's sad, sad, even tragic, and then it turns out to be a joke. Just when you believe in one thing, and then, bam, it turns in another direction. That was the move I found.'",
        "The ballet premiered at the National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre of Ukraine named after T. H. Shevchenko (National Opera of Ukraine) on June 29, 2017. The premiere of the ballet marked the conclusion of the 149th theatre season."
